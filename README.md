# TalentedClassic
WoW addon. A replacement to the default talent UI that allows creation of templates and viewing of all trees at once.

Talented and Talented_Data are required for the game.

Talented_Data_Export is a quick script to pull data from the game (which must be used on every class!).
Manual substitutions must be made using regex to then create the required files, but hopefully this never has to be done again (for WoW Classic, anyway).
