# TalentedClassic
WoW addon. A replacement to the default talent UI that allows creation of templates and viewing of all trees at once.

Talented and Talented_Data are required for the game.

Talented_Data_Export is a quick script to pull data from the game (which must be used on every class!).
Manual substitutions must be made using regex to then create the required files, but hopefully this never has to be done again (for WoW Classic, anyway).

This was an addon originally written by "Jerry" (URL: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12593-Talented.html). The project is since abandoned, so I adapted code from the Cataclysm and TBC eras to form this version. I am releasing it as a beta to solicit ideas from others on how to fix outstanding issues.

Feature List (adapted from original page)

    See the complete talent tree on a single frame.
    View and switch to your alternate spec when you've bought it.
    Create and view templates for all classes.
    Apply complete templates with a single click, after a talent wipe.
    Share your current build with others, or any template you've made.
    Import and export templates directly from Wowhead.
    A macro command /talented apply <template> allows to automatically apply a template based on its name.
